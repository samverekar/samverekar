## What I Build
I build products that sit on top of fragile infrastructure, human operations, and real unit economics. Most of my work has been in markets where reliability and cost matter more than growth hacks.

## How I Think About Products
- Infrastructure readiness dictates product timing
- Operations failures kill more products than UX
- Metrics must survive contact with reality
- Not all growth compounds
- Some products must be killed early
