## What I Build

## How I Think About Products
- Infrastructure readiness dictates product timing
- Operations failures kill more products than UX
- Metrics must survive contact with reality
- Not all growth compounds
- Some products must be killed early

## Selected Public Work

- network-led-product-design
- live-sports-infra-marketplace
- infra-cost-breakdowns

## What I Don’t Do
- Feature-first roadmaps
- Vanity metrics
- Demo-only architectures
- Products that depend on perfect user behavior
